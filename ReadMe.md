Serves as my homework repo for Upenn [CIS 519 Applied Machine Learning](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5190/spring2023/schedule.html) and [CIS 520 Machine Learning](https://machine-learning-upenn.github.io/calendar)

For some reason I dropped CIS 520 after the first homework. Only CIS 519 will be updated
